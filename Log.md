# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 10, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Plan what to work on for first few weeks.

**Thoughts** : I'm looking forward to becoming more familiar with NumPy and gaining practice learning CNN's, RNN's, GAN's, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.


## Day 1 : July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress** : Complete most of Topic 1 in my [Learning Plan](https://github.com/blynotes/100DaysOfML_2018/blob/master/LearningPlan.md).  Build a feedforward network with backpropagation using NumPy

**Thoughts** : It was a good refresher. I am feeling more comfortable with NumPy.
