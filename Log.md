# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 10, 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Plan what to work on for first few weeks.

**Thoughts** : I'm looking forward to becoming more familiar with NumPy and gaining practice learning CNN's, RNN's, GAN's, and Deep Reinforcement Learning.


## Day 1 : July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
- Complete most of Topic 1 in my [Learning Plan](https://github.com/blynotes/100DaysOfMLCode_2018/blob/master/LearningPlan.md).
- Build a basic feedforward network with backpropagation using NumPy. This is based off of [Trask's Neural Network in 11 Lines of Python](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/)
- Modify my basic feedforward network to handle dynamic number of layers.

**Thoughts** : 
- It was a good refresher. I am feeling more comfortable with NumPy.
- I will move onto Topic 2 tomorrow and slowly continue reading the Deep Learning Book Part 1.

## Day 2 : July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
- Install Tensorflow on laptop
- Explore Tensorboard
- Read CS20 Tensorflow overview
- Read CS20 Tensorflow Operations

**Thoughts** :
- Tensorflow looks powerful.  I'm looking forward to writing some test programs tomorrow and playing with Tensorboard more.

**Link of Work:**
- None today


## Day 3 : July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
- Read CS20 (Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research) lectures and slides

**Thoughts** : 
- There is a lot of information in these slides.  I will start to play with Tensorflow and then come back in a few weeks to understand them better.

**Link of Work:**
- None today


## Day 4 : July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress** : 
- Completed 2 tutorials on the Tensorflow website:
  - Basic Classification Tutorial
  - Text Classification Tutorial

**Thoughts** : 
- It is very helpful to follow the tutorials.  It helps me understand how to write Tensorflow and Keras code.
